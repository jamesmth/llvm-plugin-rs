//! This crate gives the ability to safely implement passes for the [new LLVM pass manager],
//! by leveraging the strongly typed interface  provided by [Inkwell].
//!
//! If you have never developed LLVM passes before, you can take a look at the available
//! [examples]. They will (hopefully) give you a better idea of how to use this crate.
//!
//! If you want a deeper understanding of the many concepts surrounding the new LLVM
//! pass manager, you should read the [official LLVM documentation].

//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! An LLVM plugin is merely a dylib that is given a [PassBuilder] by the LLVM tool
//! (e.g. [opt], [lld]) loading it. A [PassBuilder] allows registering callbacks on
//! specific actions being performed by the LLVM tool.
//!
//! For instance, the `--passes` parameter of [opt] allows specifying a custom pass pipeline
//! to be run on a given IR module. A plugin could therefore register a callback for
//! parsing an element of the given pipeline (e.g. a pass name), in order to insert a custom
//! pass to run by [opt].
//!
//! The following code illustrates the idea:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use llvm_plugin::inkwell::module::Module;
//! # use llvm_plugin::{
//! #     LlvmModulePass, ModuleAnalysisManager, PassBuilder, PipelineParsing, PreservedAnalyses,
//! # };
//! // A name and version is required.
//! #[llvm_plugin::plugin(name = "plugin_name", version = "0.1")]
//! fn plugin_registrar(builder: &mut PassBuilder) {
//!     // Add a callback to parse a name from the textual representation of
//!     // the pipeline to be run.
//!     builder.add_module_pipeline_parsing_callback(|name, manager| {
//!         if name == "custom-pass" {
//!             // the input pipeline contains the name "custom-pass",
//!             // so we add our custom pass to the pass manager
//!             manager.add_pass(CustomPass);
//!
//!             // we notify the caller that we were able to parse
//!             // the given name
//!             PipelineParsing::Parsed
//!         } else {
//!             // in any other cases, we notify the caller that our
//!             // callback wasn't able to parse the given name
//!             PipelineParsing::NotParsed
//!         }
//!     });
//! }
//!
//! struct CustomPass;
//! impl LlvmModulePass for CustomPass {
//!     fn run_pass(
//!         &self,
//!         module: &mut Module,
//!         manager: &ModuleAnalysisManager
//!     ) -> PreservedAnalyses {
//!         // transform the IR
//!         # PreservedAnalyses::All
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now, executing this command would run our custom pass on the input module:
//!
//! ```bash
//! opt --load-pass-plugin=libplugin.so --passes=custom-pass module.bc -disable-output
//! ```
//!
//! However, executing this command would not (`custom-pass2` cannot be parsed by our plugin):
//!
//! ```bash
//! opt --load-pass-plugin=libplugin.so --passes=custom-pass2 module.bc -disable-output
//! ```
//!
//! More callbacks are available, read the [PassBuilder] documentation for more details.
//!
//! # A note on Windows
//!
//! On this platform, LLVM plugins need the LLVM symbols directly from the executable loading
//! them (most of the time `opt.exe` or `lld.exe`). Therefore, you need to specify the
//! additional feature `win-link-opt` or `win-link-lld` while building a plugin. The former
//! will link the plugin to `opt.lib`, the latter being for `lld.lib`.
